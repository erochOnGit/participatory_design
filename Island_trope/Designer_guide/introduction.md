# Introduction for ___Participatory Design Fiction___

The ___Participatory Design Fiction___ is going to put yourself into the role of a game master helping players to design a dispositive.  

To quickly getting started you need to consider 2 elements that are the core of the project : 
 - you will need to narrate the fiction to immerge the participants.   
 - you will not be th author of the outcome of the session

What you need to start is participant (start with few) and a scenario on which you will refer to narrate.  
Design tools will probably be handful for this introduction we are going to use sketching practice to co-design.
