# Introduction for ___Participatory Design Fiction___

```
A getting started to your first workshop  
```
The ___Participatory Design Fiction___ is going to put yourself into the role of a game master helping players to design a dispositive.  

To quickly getting started you need to consider 2 elements that are the core of the project : 
 - you will need to narrate the fiction to immerge the participants.   
 - you will not be the author of the outcome of the session

In this exercise the participants needs to be immerged into a fictitious space in order to co-concieve, share and appropriate to themselves the outcome of the collaboration.
You will be the vector of this production as proffesionnal designer and will be a helper, a mentor, a guide but not the author designer.
Where you'll fade out will emerge the participants involvment.

## What is needed 
What you need to start is participant (start with few) and a scenario on which you will refer to narrate.
[The Trope of the Island](../content/Story1FR.md) is a good base to start with.  
Design tools will probably be handful for this introduction we are going to use sketching practice to co-design.

## Preparation 
To prepare the what is going to be the workshop session you'll need creative tools that can be used genericly like paper and pen. More complex materials ([like small cardboard to co-design furniture](http://www.theses.fr/s256242)) can be used depending on the theme, the scenario, the users etc... but for a first session drawing is good enough.

>These are not for you it's for the participants. So make sure to bring enough for everyone.

Secondly you'll need to prepare images and/or sound recording beforehand. These pictures are here to help immersion of the collaborators. They will provide content as well as material that the collaborators will be able to use in their conception.

> Don't bring your expansive argentic pictures. We want someting that we can cut and draw on.

Thirdly you'll have to prepare narrative guidelines to introduce design methodologies. 
You want the participant to not go overboard leaving the crew or proposing solutions individually.  
Ideation exercises and design activities offer a good way to generate milestones in your workshop.
This will allow to determine the thread that will lead to an intersting outcome.  
As the Designer you're going to need flexibility on theses milestones. Being able to absorb what the participant want to address first letting go what you would have priorities yourself. If a participant propose a way to ideate it is often worth pickingup on it.  

> But in practice what does it look like ?

For a first try we w

You'll go through

You start by introducing the story to your participant. Immerge them to the fictitious space they need to collabore.

Then you put your first milestone.  
Take a starting point by making the participant d√©grossir toward a problem by faire state of the art
