# Introduction for ___Participatory Design Fiction___ workshop

```
A getting started to your first workshop  
```
In this ___Participatory Design Fiction___ workshop you have the role of a game master - you are helping players to design an outcome to a fictitious matter they want to address.

To get started quickly you need to consider 2 elements that are the core of the project :
 - you will need to narrate the fiction to immerse the participants.   
 - you will not be the author of the outcome of the session

In this introductory event participants need to be immersed into a fictitious space in order to co-conceive, share and appropriate the outcome of the collaboration.
You will be the vector of this production as professional designer. You will also be a helper, a mentor, a guide - but you will not be the author/designer.
The participants involvement will emerge when you fade out.

## What is needed
What you need to start is :

- participants (start with few - 3 to 5 should work great)

- a scenario on which you will refer to narrate.
[The Trope of the Island](../content/Story1FR.md) is a good base to start with.  

Design tools will probably be useful for this introduction. One of the tools I suggest we use here is sketching as a practice for co-design.

## Preparation

- To prepare the workshop session, you'll need creative tools that can be used generically such as a piece of paper and a pen per participant.

> More complex materials ([like small cardboard to co-design furniture](http://www.theses.fr/s256242)) can be used depending on the theme, the scenario, the users etc... For a first session drawing is good enough.


>These are not for you it's for the participants. So make sure to bring enough for everyone.

- Secondly you'll need to prepare images and/or sound recordings beforehand. These pictures are here to facilitate immersion. They will provide content as well as material that the collaborators will be able to use in their conception.


>Don't bring your expensive argentic pictures. We want something that we can cut and draw on, chop up, stick, play with.

- Thirdly you'll follow narrative guidelines to introduce design methodologies.

>You want the participant to not go overboard leaving the crew or proposing solutions individually.  

Ideation exercises and design activities offer a good way to generate milestones in your workshop.
This will allow to determine the thread that will lead to an interesting outcome.  
As the Designer you're going to need to be flexible with these milestones. Being able to absorb what the participants want to address first, letting go what you would have prioritised yourself. If a participant suggests a way to ideate, it is often worth picking up on it.  

> But in practice what does it look like?

## Start workshopping!

For a first try we are going to propose a generic thread that you can follow or edit.

Theses steps are connected through a storyline that both you and the participant will perform.

In the following section, we will explore the following steps:

 - Introducing the environment
 - Listing the participants needs
 - Listing what surrounds them
   - From that they shall decide what they want to address in the situation
   - They will then use or/and update the information they gathered.
   - They will then ideate and reach an outcome.
   - They will finally exhibit/explain their production.

### Introducing the environment

Start by introducing the story. Immerse them in the fictitious space in which they need to collaborate.
Don't hesitate to elaborate on details that could enhance the immersion.

>An example you can pick up is the first paragraphe of [the Trope of the Island](../content/Story1FR.md).

### Listing the participants' needs

You will now invite the participants to list their needs.

>This is your first milestone.

This can be done in multiple ways and the designer's job is to suggest an exercise that fits the context. They can take turns listing needs. One can also bring up a cartography exercise where participants can add what they feel is important from the information they received from the narration and observed from the different content you decided to show.

You don't want to lose the participant's focus. In order for them to stay attentive we suggest you use a time frame within the context of the narration.

In [the Trope of the Island](../content/Story1FR.md) the night goes down after the first meeting. You could frame it by saying "the night will fall in 5 minutes" and put a timer on.

### Listing what surrounds them

Create a transition through immersive narration - much like a cinematic in a video game.
You can now bring the participants to interactively observe what surrounds them.

> Slowly but surely you can install your second milestone.

As during the first milestone activities, you can use multiple design methods to bring the participant to work.
Here you can provide information on their surrounding. This will spur from the action they decide to take, and you may use the material you prepared.

_For example, the participants could decide to walk along the beach. You can provide a photo of a small empty town they encounter, and ask for their reaction. If they decide to explore the place, they can chose 2 objects they find. In the end after one or multiple explorations, you can ask them to list what they have at their disposal._

As with the first milestone don't hesitate to spend time with these actions. You can say : "it takes me one hour to go to this village [...] it takes you two hours to explore - the sun is starting to be high in the sky, you are starting to feel hungry."

>Wow ! Now we have achieved two things : your participants are immersed in a fictitious world, and they have acknowledged their needs but also what defines their environment. From that, ideas on what to create can rise.  

### having participants decide what they want to address in the situation

In this situation participants needs to reach an agreement. This is the most conflictual part of the session. As a designer you can use methods to ease this process, and as a game master you can also help them move forward without them forfeiting because of their difficult position.

>It is the third milestone

- An example would be to have the participants reach their conclusion within 5 minute because a huge storm is coming. As they know there a constraint, they push themselves to find what they need to address quickly.

- Another example would be providing food through narration if they want to address other issues but they are stopped because of needs they can't assess.

- It can be helpful to suggest solutions outside of story-led elements when it comes to the methods needed to reach agreements. An easy way to do that is to use a non-player-character (an individual played by another designer or an actor to interact with the participants at a certain point) that is in a position of importance. This character could propose ways to debates if the participants seem to be confused or disrepectful to the exercise and to each other.

> The participants start to orient themselves towards the outcome of the session!

### Participants use or/and update the information they gathered.

<!-- //[This part exists to briefly consider the possibility of repeat on the steps that have been done until now.]

In this part, the participants will consider  repeating the first part to create a new iteration. On en rediscute plus tard.// -->

The participant may have figured out things they missed that they need to explore again in order to solve the issue they identified earlier.
Iteration is an important part of the design process. If the participants want to do so, don't hesitate suggest synthesising what they have in order to be able to reflect on their progression later on.

### Make them ideate and reach an outcome

Finally the participant have to think about the thing they want to address.
We suggest that you start with ideation exercises they can do on their own to then share their ideas and loop on this process to reach good ideas that are commonly shared.

> ideation design methods are here the fourth milestone

One that is working very well is the crazy 8's. 
You basically cut 8 piece of paper (making rectangles by folding 3 times also work). You put a 1 minute timer eight times. For each times the participant need to draw and/or write an explanation of a solution.
They don't need to be super creative they can just change simple things in their ideas.
Once the 8 minutes are done there is an explaination session. Everyone takes turn telling what their drawing consist of.
<!-- meh incoming -->
Once it's done the exercise repeat and people will be able to use the other participants ideas or new ideas they had after the 8 precendent minutes.
<!-- not sure about the precedent sentence -->
The exercise iterate as much as needed until one or more good common idea come up and poeple feel satisfied of the situation.

> Amazing you made participant ideate something even if they are not designer themselves. 

### Have them exhibit/explain their production  

In order to put theory into practice and make the participant build an experience that will resonate with his real environment we suggest to make him do a restitution.

> The final and Fifth milestone is this presentation

The presentation we suggest you have for your first session is a recipe. It's a really simple thing that poeple will probably know how to do and if not it can be explain by saying make a list of ingredient and then make a list of step that use them, that's it.

The more physical the restitution is the more resonating it will be with the participant real environment so keep in mind if you can do it physicly. 

Thanks for reading lol
