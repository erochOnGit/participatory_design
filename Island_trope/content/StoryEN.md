The clouds are white under the plane. The passengers are chatting a bit, but mostly they have their eyes riveted on their phones, books or tablets; some are even sleeping with their fists closed. We've been flying for several hours now, and we still have 6 hours to go before we reach our final destination, Australia.
Suddenly, the plane's loudspeakers crackle and the pilot's hesitant voice is heard: "Ladies and gentlemen," he says, "I don't really know how to tell you the terribly shocking news we have just heard. The air base at Pointapitre has just made contact with our aircraft, and the instructions are clear: we cannot reach a continent. I will therefore... make an emergency landing on the nearest island you can see from your window, called Sao Miguel. Our pilot pauses for a few moments and then continues "Don't panic. Just know that we are going to stay on this island for an indefinite time. Unfortunately, a country has decided to use nuclear weapons, and we are only safe far from land." His voice breaks. "We'll have to learn to survive, together."
It only takes about thirty minutes before we feel the clutch of a plane touching down. The pilot has chosen a long beach to land on. The passengers get out of the plane, slightly shocked.

>After this introduction, our participants become the characters who will intervene. The overall framework of the story is still maintained by the narrator, but a form of freedom is offered to the participants-characters, a bit like the members of a role-playing game. One of the workshop organisers participates in the co-creation process by guiding it.

A passenger, therefore, asks himself what he should do first. Visit the island? Make an inventory of what we find on the plane?

>This passenger is our creator participant. They nudge the participants by inviting them to make creative choices, without imposition from the narrator.

The passengers debate. As night falls, they decide that tonight they will stay on the plane. They realise that there is not much water and food on the plane - so they will have to discover the resources of this island, abandoned a decade ago by its inhabitants, the next day.
The next morning, the passengers decide to walk along the coast, and in so doing, list their needs. The most urgent need, insists one of them, is drinking water! A consensus emerges: they will have to find a way to synthesise it, as they have not found any on the island.
Several proposals are raised.

>Here, the participants are invited to explore their surroundings and ask questions about the visual environment proposed to them. They each propose two solutions to the problem they have identified, sketch solutions on paper, list the materials needed. Our aim here is to recover "recipes" for low-tech designs that meet the primary needs identified by the participants.

The passengers decide to make a water maker. They will heat a pot found in the vicinity, collect the evaporated water in external containers.

>This is where our fiction ends. The passengers can decide to do a number of different things - it doesn't have to be about water, it depends on them.
